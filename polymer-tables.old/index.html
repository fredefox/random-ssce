<!--
    This example *must* be run with a web-server. The reason for this is that
    it's in violation with the same-origin policy to serve files from the file-
    system - however weird that sounds.

    This example doesn't work in firefox. It's an issue with the load-order.

    There's also an issue in Chrome. I would have used the `defer` attribute
    on the main script - but that would oddly break the load-order when The
    script is located in a seperate file.
